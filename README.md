This app refers to [the tutorial](https://youtu.be/NU-HfZY3ATQ), while I pick Vue as the JS framework, not React. Also, I use Sass rather than CSS as the tutorial does.

I didn't use the library -- "react-scroll-to-bottom", because I built the app with Vue rather than React. Instead, I use [Element.scrollIntoView API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) for scrolling down to the latest message when new messages coming in.
